# styrene-process-simulator

Main methods are located in the SWDAL2 and SWDAL3 files - compile and run these to run a basic simulation of a styrene process. The goal of each simulation is to detemine the ideal operating conditions for a styrene reactor (Temperature and Pressure) that result in the maximum economic potential considering only the costs of raw materials and value of products. The L2 file runs the simulation without a recycle of unreacted ethylbenzene, while the L3 file considers a recycle of all unreacted ethylbenzene.
